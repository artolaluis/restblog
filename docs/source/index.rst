Blogging using reStructuredText
===============================

What is restblog?
-----------------

restblog is a simple utility to manage the contents of a Wordpress blog using
reStructuredText. It is written in Python and consists of a simple
command-line interface that allows you to create, edit and delete posts and
pages.

The Python API is well documented and can be easily used to build other
tools on top of it, for example, plugins for various text editors.  
It should work in pretty much any platform that has a Python interpreter and
some kind of shell or terminal. Tested in Linux, MacOS X and Windows. All you
need is a simple text editor of your choice and a shell, terminal or command
prompt.
